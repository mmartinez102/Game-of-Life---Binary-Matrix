#Game of Life - Neuromorphic AI Algorithm Application (v1.1)
#by Michael Martinez
#This program will be the first start of applying the Game of Life (GOL) as a neuromorphic AI algorithm to control a basic robot. The robot
#will have a basic ultrasonic sensor for vision, a servo motor to moving this ultrasonic sensor, & four-wheel drive
#(4x modes - forward/backward drive for both right and left side wheels). The idea is to test whether the patterns that develop in the GOL
#can be used as a method of storing information over past stimuli but in an ever changing manner. A basic matrix will be created for this
#algorithm. The hope is that the robot will learn to perform obstacle avoidance without having been programmed to do so.
